# godot-campfire

A campfire for the Godot game engine with particle effects and 2D pixel art sprite animation.

Sprites are custom assets created in Krita and particle effects were created based on [KidsCanCode's tutorial on the Particles2D node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awBfTnmgn7k).

This project was created with Godot v3.2.2.
